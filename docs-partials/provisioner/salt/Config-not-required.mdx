- `target_os` (string) - The target OS that the workload is using. This value is used to determine whether a
  Windows or Linux OS is in use. If not specified, this value defaults to `linux`.

- `state_files` ([]string) - The state files to be applied by Salt. These files must exist on
  your local system where Packer is executing.

  applying Salt states. By default this is set to `false`.

- `environment_vars` ([]string) - Env Vars

- `env_var_format` (string) - Env Var Format

- `state_directory` (string) - A path to the complete Salt structure on your local system
  to be copied to the remote machine as the `staging_directory` before all
  other files and directories.
