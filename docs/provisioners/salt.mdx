# Salt Provisioner

Type: `salt`

The Salt Packer provisioner executes Salt's "masterless" or "local"
mode on the guest operating system of the image that Packer is building.
Salt state files that exist on the guest operating system are used to customize
the image to meet a defined desired state. This means the Salt Minion package
must be installed on the guest operating system.
State files can be uploaded from your local build machine (the one running
Packer) by this plugin. Salt is then invoked on the guest machine in [masterless
mode](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/quickstart.html)
via the `salt-call` command.

-> **Note:** The current version of this plugin does **not** automatically install the required `salt-minion` package. It is assumed when calling this provisioner that installation of the Salt Minion has already taken place. Commonly users may employ the [shell provisioner](/packer/docs/provisioners/shell) (or similar) to install the Salt Minion or include the necessary steps within their KickStart or seed file for their build. Instructions for installing the Salt Minion are be located on the [SaltProject website](https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/).

-> **Note:** The `salt-minion` package need only be installed, it does not need to be enabled as a service or configured with a Salt Master.

## Basic Example

The example below is fully functional.

**HCL2**

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    salt = {
      version = ">= 0.5.0"
      source  = "github.com/mpoore/salt"
    }
  }
}

variable "topping" {
  type    = string
  default = "mushroom"
}

source "docker" "example" {
  image       = "mpoore/salt-example:latest"
  export_path = "packer_example"
  run_command = ["-d", "-i", "-t", "--entrypoint=/bin/bash", "{{.Image}}"]
}

build {
  sources = [
    "source.docker.example"
  ]

  provisioner "salt" {
    state_files      = [ "example.sls" ]
    environment_vars = [ "TOPPINGS=${ var.topping }" ]
  }
}
```

where example.sls contains

```
echo_toppings:
  cmd.run:
    - name: 'echo $TOPPINGS'
```

## Configuration Reference

The reference of available configuration options is listed below.

Required (one, not both, of):

- `state_files` (array of strings) - The individual state files to be applied by Salt. These files must exist on
	your local system where Packer is executing. State files are applied in the order
	in which they appear in the `state_files` parameter.

- `state_tree` (array of strings) - A path to the complete Salt State Tree on your local system to be copied to the remote machine.
  The structure of the State Tree is flexible, however the use of this option assumes
	that a `top.sls` file is present at the top of the State Tree. The plugin assumes that Salt will evaluate
	the `top.sls` file and match expressions to determine which individual states should be applied. This action
	is referred to as a "highstate".

Optional:

@include '/provisioner/salt/Config-not-required.mdx'

@include 'provisioners/common-config.mdx'
