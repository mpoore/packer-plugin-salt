# Salt Provisioner

Type: `salt`

The `ansible-local` Packer provisioner will execute `ansible` in Ansible's "local"
mode on the remote/guest VM using Playbook and Role files that exist on the
guest VM. This means Ansible must be installed on the remote/guest VM.
Playbooks and Roles can be uploaded from your build machine (the one running
Packer) to the vm. Ansible is then run on the guest machine in [local
mode](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_delegation.html#local-playbooks)
via the `ansible-playbook` command.

-> **Note:** The current version of this plugin does **not** automatically install the required `salt-minion` package. It is assumed when calling this provisioner that installation of the `salt-minion` has already taken place. Commonly users may employ the [shell provisioner](/packer/docs/provisioners/shell) (or similar) to install the `salt-minion` or include the necessary steps within their KickStart or seed file for their build. Instructions for installing the `salt-minion` are be located on the [SaltProject website](https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/).

-> **Note:** The `salt-minion` package need only be installed, it does not need to be enabled as a service or configured with a `salt-master`.

## Basic Example

The example below is fully functional.

**HCL2**

```hcl
variable "topping" {
  type    = string
  default = "mushroom"
}

source "docker" "example" {
  image       = "williamyeh/ansible:ubuntu14.04"
  export_path = "packer_example"
  run_command = ["-d", "-i", "-t", "--entrypoint=/bin/bash", "{{.Image}}"]
}

build {
  sources = [
    "source.docker.example"
  ]

  provisioner "ansible-local" {
    playbook_file   = "./playbook.yml"
    extra_arguments = ["--extra-vars", "\"pizza_toppings=${var.topping}\""]
  }
}
```

where ./playbook.yml contains

```
---
- name: hello world
  hosts: 127.0.0.1
  connection: local

  tasks:
    - command: echo {{ pizza_toppings }}
    - debug: msg="{{ pizza_toppings }}"

```

## Configuration Reference

The reference of available configuration options is listed below.

Required (one, not both, of):

- `state_files` (array of strings) - The individual state files to be applied by Salt. These files must exist on
	your local system where Packer is executing. State files are applied in the order
	in which they appear in the `state_files` parameter.

- `state_tree` (array of strings) - A path to the complete Salt State Tree on your local system to be copied to the remote machine.
  The structure of the State Tree is flexible, however the use of this option assumes
	that a `top.sls` file is present at the top of the State Tree. The plugin assumes that Salt will evaluate
	the `top.sls` file and match expressions to determine which individual states should be applied. This action
	is referred to as a "highstate".
